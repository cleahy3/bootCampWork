#Agile

##Agile Manifesto
* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools. 
* Working software over comprehensive documentation. 
* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
*  Responding to change over following a plan.

##Principles
1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software
2. Welcome changing requirements even late in development, agile processes harness change for the customers competitive advantage 
3. delivery of working software frequently from a couple of weeks to a couple of months with a preference to the shorter timescale 
4. business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project
5. build projects around motivated individuals, give them the environment and support they need and trust them to get the job done.
6. the most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation
7. working software is the primary measure of progress
8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely. 
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility. 
10. Simplicity—the art of maximising the amount of work not done—is essential. 
    1. don’t overcomplicate
11. the best architects requirements and designs emerge from self-organising teams
    1. the best person to organise you is yourself
12. at regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behaviour
    1. reflect in order to improve

### Agile Exercise 10-12

10- Web development at uni, stuck to the marking scheme, did what was asked- got a 2:1 for that unit 
11- Team project at uni, no real leader, everyone just did what we all knew was going to work and did it, no micro managing -attained a first, so benefited.
12- 


##Being Agile

Being vs Doing (Using your brain, the point of agile is to be able to change and adapt, being agile even takes the agile methodology with an agile mindset)

_CA agile vision - manages product backlog_

###Key Points from Video
* Time to market
* Certainty
* Increase revenue by focusing on customer value
* Scope
* Incremental - breaking things up
* Product Backlog
* retrospective

* break big problems or work items into smaller chunks
* focus on the most important business chunks
* ensure what you deliver works
* actively seek feedback
* change course when necessary
* ensure what you deliver works
* actively seek feedback
* change course when necessary
* team accountability



_Prioritised backlog_ - A list of user stories in order of importance to the product owner
** Definition of done** - each team might have a definition of done, could mean entirely different levels of complete

#Agile Teams
* co-located


One whole team - open office
co-located and a full team of a mixture of roles combined


Many Silos- Everyone is closed off, nobody communicated to full capability

* Product owner communicates with client as much as needed to elicit requirements
* BA - takes the user stories to fill with acceptance criteria (A checklist or requirements for a story to be complete
* Developer - builds stuff, needs to have a mixed bag of skills
* project manager- not always necessary, would usually sit above many agile teams rather than in the traditional sense that the project manager would sit on one.
* Agile Tester- Will again be a mixed bag, may help the BA to create success criteria, everyone is involved
* Designer/UX-

##User Stories
* _Differentiate between features, epics and user stories_
* _Explain user personas_
* _Write a user story_
* _Write acceptance criteria_

###User Stories 
* Written from a users point of view
* ties it to the requirements to a user's needs
* usually describes functionality
* promise of a future conversation, not a whole set of requirements


###Good Story
* Understandable(by normal people)
* Follow as a... I want ... so that ...
* **I**ndependent of other user stories regarding completion (leans towards waterfall model, and dependency problems)
* **N**egotiable (Should be multiple ways to deliver the user story)
* **V**aluable (Useful to the user and the business)
* **E**stimable (put a time frame on it)
* **S**mall(not too big that they aren't estimable without breaking down)
* **T**estable (must be able to test that it works, else it may be a bad story)

I.N.V.E.S.T

Six User Stories

User personas, giving users a name and a personality to put a realistic idea to your user stories
